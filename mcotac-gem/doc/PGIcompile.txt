         ( Parallel Fortran and C++ )    

  This instruction applies to node-gem, nodearray-gem,
          rockflow-gem and mcotac-gem modules.

     1.	To connect to PGI server:
        
         - Open a Linux terminal ( “konsole”).
          
         - To open a SSH terminal type:
            ssh dmitrieva@llc (password:          )

     2.	Go to work directory

        cd /afs/psi.ch/project/gems/standalone/node-gem
           (maybe using “mc”)

     3.	To update the node-gem source code, execute 

          svn update <password>

     4.	To Build the node-gem executable file, execute

          make
                           
     5. To save changes to sourse code on SVN server, execute
